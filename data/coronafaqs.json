             "answer":"It is difficult to compare a completely new illness, such as COVID-19, with the seasonal flu. Based on current knowledge, the two diseases show some similarities in terms of symptoms. Most people develop mild symptoms, but some get seriously ill and some people die.\n    However, COVID-19 will affect many more people in a population where it spreads. The rapid spread of disease is due to the lack of immunity against the completely new virus. Therefore, more people will fall ill from it, and more people will need to be cared for in a hospital.\n    Different versions of the seasonal flu appears every year, and it has been present for a long time. Therefore, some immunity has had time to build up in the population. There is also a vaccine and other medications against seasonal flu.",

             "question":"What are the symptoms of COVID-19?",
             "answer":"In most people, COVID-19 manifests as a respiratory tract infection, and many different symptoms may be present. It is not possible to distinguish COVID-19 from other infections from only the symptoms – a laboratory test is required.\n    Among the reported symptoms are:\n    \n    Cough\n    Fever\n    Difficulty breathing\n    Runny nose\n    Blocked nose\n    Sore throat\n    Headache\n    Nausea\n    Muscle and joint pain\n    \n    A person falling ill with COVID-19 may experience one or more of these symptoms. It is fairly common to lose one’s sense of smell and taste for some time during an infection in the upper respiratory tract. Diarrhea has also been reported as a symptom.\n    Most people get mild symptoms and can recover at home without professional medical care. The symptoms often appear gradually. Some people get a severe form of the illness, with breathing difficulties and pneumonia.\n    The list of symptoms may be adjusted over time, since we update our information as new knowledge becomes available, e.g. in scientific studies or from the WHO.\n    The time between getting infected and developing symptoms (the incubation period) seems to be between 2 and 14 days. Most people develop symptoms after 5 days.\n    It is very important that you stay at home if you feel ill. If you can no longer manage the illness on your own, please call 1177 for medical advice (available in English).",

Transmission via droplets happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The virus can also spread from person to person via physical contact.\n    You can decrease the risk of transmission by keeping your hands clean and avoiding touching your face, and by keeping a distance from people that are ill.",

             "answer":"The current number of confirmed cases, in Sweden and globally, is displayed here (in Swedish). The figures change constantly, as more people seek healthcare and are diagnosed with the disease.\n    Until March 12th 2020 all suspected cases among people travelling from affected areas to Sweden were followed up with sampling and contact tracing. From March 13th 2020 the following groups are prioritized for sampling:\n    \n    Hospitalised patients\n    People that work in healthcare or elderly care, with suspected COVID-19.\n    \n    This means that the number of reported cases is lower from March 13th, and that the number of cases before and after the change of sampling routines are not comparable.\n    Since COVID-19 causes mild symptoms in many of those infected, it is likely that the number of cases reported is lower than the actual number of cases. Specific investigations are carried out to monitor how the disease spreads across Sweden, for example by testing influenza samples for COVID-19. The aim with such data collection is to learn more about how COVID-19 is transmitted and how healthcare services are affected.",

             "answer":"Since the virus is new, we have limited knowledge about which groups might run a higher risk of developing severe illness, or how much higher the risk is for them. Available data from the ongoing outbreak indicate that old age is the most prominent risk factor.\n    Older age combined with pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, or diabetes is also associated with developing a severe form of COVID-19.\n    People with asthma, allergies, or kidney disease are not identified as risk groups in the available studies. However, it is unclear to what extent these conditions have been studied and it can therefore not be excluded that they run a higher risk of severe illness. If you or your child have a condition that makes you vulnerable to infectious diseases, for example problems with the immune system, you should seek advice from your doctor about how to manage your condition and how to decrease the risks associated with COVID-19.\n    A Chinese study shows that only a small proportion of the identified risk groups actually develop severe illness. It is currently difficult to assess whether these findings translate to Swedish conditions. Reports from Italy indicate that people over the age of 85 are most at risk.",

Comparisons with other diseases caused by SARS-coronavirus and MERS-coronavirus indicate that COVID-19 causes fewer complications during pregnancy.\n    As in all cases of pneumonia, the risk of severe illness can be somewhat higher, especially towards the end of the pregnancy. There are only few reports of children that have contracted COVID-19 during pregnancy or birth.\n    At present, there is only limited information about COVID-19 and pregnancy. We recommend that pregnant women take the same precautions as against all infectious diseases.

We currently do not recommend these tests, since they are much less reliable than the tests used in healthcare. The methods used professionally are highly sensitive and specific. Tests are combined with clinical observations, epidemiological information and patient history to support a diagnosis.\n    A test with low sensitivity, or used during the wrong phase of the infection, might indicate that you do not have COVID-19 although you are infected.\n    We currently have limited knowledge about the accuracy of tests for home use, and there are no published data regarding their ability to diagnose COVID-19.",

It states that most of those that had mild symptoms (fever and cough) got well again after two weeks. For those that developed more severe illness, it took between three and six weeks to get well.\n    Those that were severely ill had breathing difficulties (shortness of breath and low oxygenation of the blood).

Take your usual allergy medication. If the symptoms do not get worse, your medication relieves the symptoms, and your judgement is that the symptoms are likely to be caused by allergy, you do not need to remain home.\n    If you experience new symptoms that you do not associate with your allergy, or if you get a fever, you should stay home until they have cleared and another two days.",

From what we know now, transmission does not seem to occur during the incubation period, i.e. the time between contracting the virus and developing symptoms. Those that have been exposed to COVID-19 should pay attention to any early signs of illness.\n    Our stance is based on the following:\n    \n    There are robust scientific studies from the coronavirus that cause the disease SARS, which spread around the world in 2003. Evaluations of that outbreak show that the SARS-coronavirus does not transmit at all during the incubation period. Among all currently known viral diseases, transmission during the incubation period is very uncommon. Many viruses spread around the time that a patient develops symptoms. There is reason to believe that this applies also to this new coronavirus.\n    Many cases of the ongoing outbreak have been identified, but none of them have confirmed transmission during the incubation period.\n    \n    Our knowledge about the new coronavirus increases every day and we monitor the development closely. Our assessments are based on the latest available credible data, and any changes to our current advice will be communicated widely.

             "answer":"The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) is mainly transmitted person-to-person via respiratory droplets. This means that the virus reaches the inside of your eyes, nose or mouth from droplets that are dispersed in the air when someone sneezes or coughs. The droplets fall to the ground within approximately one meter (3 ft) from the source.\n    There are reports of transmission of COVID-19 from people without any symptoms of illness. However, only a few studies describe the role of this type of transmission is relation to the overall spreading of COVID-19 in the community. Based on the available knowledge about COVID-19 and similar diseases, the current understanding is that this route of transmission represents a minor part.\n    To slow the rate of COVID-19 spreading in the community, it is important to limit the transmission of COVID-19 from those that have symptoms of illness.

Research on related coronaviruses shows that they can live for several days on surfaces and items, under particular conditions. Their survival depends on temperature, humidity, and sunlight. Coronaviruses are sensitive to dehydration. The amount of viruses present also determines how long a surface or item are contagious. Such studies are done under controlled conditions in laboratories, and are not directly transferable to other environments, for example in the community.\n    A recent study from a healthcare setting where patients with COVID-19 had been isolated shows that small amounts of genetic material from the virus can remain in the environment. Further studies will show whether living viruses also remain, and if they can spread disease.\n    It is important to maintain good hand hygiene. By washing your hands with soap and water you can decrease the risk of getting infected. If water and soap are not available, alcohol hand rub can be used instead.\n    The Public Health Agency monitors the emerging evidence, for example by collaborating with the WHO and other agencies.",

Since COVID-19 is subject to mandatory reporting under the Communicable Diseases Act, physicians and laboratories continuously supply data that is analysed by the Public Health Agency every day. Other sources of data are random samples from patients that present to their healthcare provider with symptoms of influenza, or from other groups of people. Statistics from the medical advice service 1177 (web searches and telephone calls) is also used to monitor the situation. The Public Health Agency issues a weekly report showing the number of COVID-19 cases, starting from March 20th 2020.\n    Collected data provides a background for decisions about interventions that serve to minimise mortality, the number of people affected by the disease, and the negative effects for society. Data from surveillance also makes it possible to monitor and evaluate the effects of interventions so far, and to follow and somewhat predict the further development of the pandemic.\n    Weekly reports and other information about surveillance can be found here (in Swedish).",
